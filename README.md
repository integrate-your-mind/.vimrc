This is a copy of my vim configuration. You need to use this in conjunction with https://github.com/amix/vimrc for everything to work properly. I still need to add a bunch of comments so this WIP but enjoy.

# WIP
## TODO 
### Add list of plugins I am currently using that are not included in amix/vim
